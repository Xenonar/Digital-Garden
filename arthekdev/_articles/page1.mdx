## The planet Draenor

The planet Draenor, which is a name which is still disputed, is an ice planet in a small solar system with five other planets.
Draenor is about 6.9 times bigger than Earth and its gravity is about 1.36 times that of Earth.

A single day lasts 25.19 hours and a year lasts 207 days. The planet is made up of 14 continents, which make up 44% of the planet's landmass.
4 moon(s) orbit the planet and Draenor itself orbits a blue sun in a slightly elliptic orbit.

The plant-like organisms on this planet are mostly small shrubs, flowers and grasses, all of which have spectacular colors, but they tend to remain quite small. Trees are spread thinly, but they tend to grow very wide, allowing them to store plenty of nutrients for when they smaller species bloom and take most of the nutrients in the ground.

Reproducing is the most important aspect to ensure the survival of a species. While many species use seeds or forms of pollination to reproduce, others simply grow into more copies of itself, all connected to one parent. However, a few species on this planet do it a little different. Some of them excrete their seeds through their roots, back into the water they normally absorb, allowing the water to carry the seeds further. Some species grow into multiple seeds from the moment they begin growing as a seed themselves. But perhaps the most impressive species is the one that grows around other species and uses their growing seeds and modifies them to become seeds of its own.

The underwater world of this planet is truly a feast for the eyes. Thousands of different soft and hard coral species cover the ocean floors, most of which have a form of bioluminescence, which makes the night even more magical than the day. These bioluminescent corals offer homes to plenty of creatures, which they need to be cleaned, while at the same time trying to attract the very same creatures with their lights so they can eat them. A truly remarkable balance.

While the higher species of this planet have yet to enter space, their mastery of flight is commendable. These creatures are almost obsessed with flying and have invented hundreds, if not thousands of different vehicles that allow them to get from A to B by flying. They're less interested in space however, as flying is far less exciting when you don't have to worry about gravity.
