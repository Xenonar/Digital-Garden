## The planet Eternium

The planet Eternium, the most popular name of the natives, is an ice planet in a vast solar system with nineteen other planets.
Eternium is about 0.6 times bigger than Earth and its gravity is about 1.09 times that of Earth.

A single day lasts 16.77 hours and a year lasts 143 days. The planet is made up of 2 continents, which make up 54% of the planet's landmass.
1 moon(s) orbit the planet and Eternium itself orbits a yellow sun in a wide, elliptic orbit.

The plant-like organisms on this planet are almost exclusively types of grass. They can reach incredible heights due to the strength of some species, while others would be barely noticeable on the floor, if not for their spectacular colors. Shrubs, bushes and flowers are also fairly prominent, but fungi and trees are nearly non-existent.

Reproducing is the most important aspect to ensure the survival of a species. While many species use seeds or forms of pollination to reproduce, others simply grow into more copies of itself, all connected to one parent. However, a few species on this planet do it a little different. Some of them excrete their seeds through their roots, back into the water they normally absorb, allowing the water to carry the seeds further. Some species grow into multiple seeds from the moment they begin growing as a seed themselves. But perhaps the most impressive species is the one that grows around other species and uses their growing seeds and modifies them to become seeds of its own.

There may be plenty of wonders on the surface, but the wonders don't stop once you delve into the deep waters of this planet. The plants of the deeps are nomadic, which means almost none of them grow in one place. Instead, most species float and drift with the currents. They let the water carry them to the nutrients. Some species will constantly float the surface, but many of the other species have developed ways to dive when needed.

When we think of higher intelligence on other planets we often think of technologically advanced species in a world far beyond that of ours. Unfortunately, this planet is nothing like that. The intelligent species on this planet, though intelligent, aren't much more advanced than humans were during the late stone age. While they do have a language, they have yet to create a written version of it, which makes potential communications between them and other alien species a bigger challenge. These species do show a great interest in space, they adore and often worship the night sky, many of them even make crude drawings of constellations, the surrounding planets and their moons.
